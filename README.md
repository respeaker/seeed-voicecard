Note: 'CO 1-2' means the coherence between channel 1 and channel 2.

```bash
# How to get the coherence of the captured audio(a.wav for example).
sudo apt install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib
python tools/coherence.py a.wav

# Requirement of the input audio file:
- format: WAV(Microsoft) signed 16-bit PCM
- channels: >=2
