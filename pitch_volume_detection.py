# This is a simple demonstration on how to stream
# audio from microphone and then extract the pitch
# and volume directly with help of PyAudio and Aubio
# Python libraries. The PyAudio is used to interface
# the computer microphone. While the Aubio is used as
# a pitch detection object. There is also NumPy
# as well to convert format between PyAudio into
# the Aubio.
